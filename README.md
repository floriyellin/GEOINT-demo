## Why this project?

- [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) is a strong segmentation model. But it need prompts (like boxes/points) to generate masks.
- [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) is a strong zero-shot detector which enable to generate high quality boxes and labels with free-form text.
- The combination of the two models enable **to detect and segment everything** with text inputs!
